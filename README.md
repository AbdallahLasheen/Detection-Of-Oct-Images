# 👁️ OCTelligence Pro | Hybrid AI Diagnostic Hub

**OCTelligence Pro is an advanced diagnostic hub that integrates DenseNet121 and Swin Transformer architectures to provide high-precision analysis of retinal OCT scans. The system automates the detection of pathologies like CNV, DME, and Drusen, delivering real-time, AI-driven insights to support clinical decision-making.**

---

## 🚀 Features
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Combines CNN (DenseNet121) for local feature extraction and Vision Transformer (Swin-T) for global contextual understanding.
* **Real-time Diagnosis:** Interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit.
* **High Accuracy:** Optimized to detect retinal diseases with specialized medical imaging preprocessing.
* **Probability Analysis:** Visualizes diagnostic confidence using Plotly charts.

## 🏥 Diseases Detected
1.  **CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization):** Abnormal blood vessel growth.
2.  **DME (Diabetic Macular Edema):** Fluid accumulation in the retina.
3.  **DRUSEN:** Early signs of age-related macular degeneration.
4.  **NORMAL:** Healthy retinal structure.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, Timm (Swin Transformer, DenseNet)
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit
* **Data Analysis:** Pandas, Plotly, Pillow
* **Storage:** Git LFS (Large File Storage) for model weights
